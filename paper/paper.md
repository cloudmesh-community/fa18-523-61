## Natural Language Applications within Big Data - :smiley: fa18-523-61

## Abstract

   This paper examines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its usage within Big Data today.  Organizations have recently begun to harness the immense power of big data and how the concept can prove to be a beneficial component.  The term big data used to be a scary term that elicited feelings of consternation and anxiety, but with organizations experiencing exponential growth in data volume, the term has become mainstream and widely accepted.  Big data is largely unstructured text and constantly in a state of enormous growth, which is why NLP offers many opportunities to tap into this vast data resource [@www.expertsystem]. This paper will explore the evolving, and sometimes challenging relationship between NLP and Big Data, the problems that NLP can solve, which applications are leveraged, and how the data can be transformed into a presentable format for consumption. 

## Introduction:

   Big data “describes the growing volume of structured and unstructured, multi-source information that is too large for traditional applications to handle [@www.expertsystem].”  The volume of today’s data is on an unprecedented growth trajectory due to the ample methods to collect and analyze data. The Internet of Things, mobile devices, sensors, cameras, and software logs are just some examples of non-traditional methods of data collection are contribute to the abundance of information today [@en.wikipedia]. There’s no end in sight to exponential growth that is projected over the next several years. According to Wikipedia: 

> "The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[11] as of         2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×1018) of data are generated.[12] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume will grow     exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020.[13] By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of       data" [@en-wikipedia].
    
   Natural Language Processing is a relatively new concept and is gaining momentum in the use of text analysis and presentation.  Elizabeth Liddy from Syracuse University provides a great definition:

> "Natural Language Processing is a theoretically motivated range of computational techniques for analyzing and representing naturally       occurring texts at one or more levels of linguistic analysis for the purpose of achieving human-like language processing for a range of   tasks or applications" [@surface.syr.edu].

Essentially NLP’s goal is to achieve a level of text analysis and processing that mimicks very closely the way that humans process language.  While NLP has truly made significant progress over the last several years, the challenge of deciphering the exact context and inference of text is still an area of which NLP is still improving [@surface.syr.edu].
